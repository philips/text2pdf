I did not write this code. I brought it into a git repo because it is
easier than wget'ting the files every time I need them from the author's
page:

text2pdf [options] [filename]

  text2pdf makes a 7-bit clean PDF file (version 1.1) from any input file.
  It reads from standard input or a named file, and writes the PDF file
  to standard output.

  There are various options as follows:

  -h		show this message
  -f<font>	use PostScript <font> (must be in standard 14, default: Courier)
  -I		use ISOLatin1Encoding
  -s<size>	use font at given pointsize (default 10)
  -v<dist>	use given line spacing (default 12 points)
  -l<lines>	lines per page (default 60, determined automatically
		if unspecified)
  -c<chars>	maximum characters per line (default 80)
  -t<spaces>	spaces per tab character (default 8)
  -F		ignore formfeed characters (^L)
  -A4		use A4 paper (default Letter)
  -A3		use A3 paper (default Letter)
  -x<width>	independent paper width in points
  -y<height>	independent paper height in points
  -2		format in 2 columns
  -L		landscape mode

  Note that where one variable is implied by two options, the second option
  takes precedence for that variable. (e.g. -A4 -y500)
  In landscape mode, page width and height are simply swapped over before
  formatting, no matter how or when they were defined.
